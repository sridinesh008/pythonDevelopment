"""creating&writing a file """

# notifies Python that you are opening this file, with the intention to write
#writing will clear the file and write to it just the data you specify in the write operation.

'''appending a file'''

# so here, generally it can be a good idea to start with a newline, since
# otherwise it will append data on the same line as the file left off.
# you might want that, but I'll use a new line.
# another option used is to first append just a simple newline
# then append what you want. 
appendMe = '\nNew bit of information'

appendFile = open('exampleFile.txt','a')

appendFile.close()
